# Projects - API used

The GEOROC 2.0 API offers a wide range of possible applications for internal and external projects. Some examples include:

**Data visualisation**: by using the API, researchers can visualise complex geochemical data to identify patterns and trends. 
Interactive maps, 3D models and graphical representations are just some of the ways in which the extensive data in the 
GEOROC database can be vividly presented.

**Analytical applications**: The API makes it possible to retrieve data for specific geochemical analyses. This can be the 
basis for detailed studies on rock formations, mineralogy and geochemical processes.

**Predictive modelling**: Using machine learning and deep learning techniques, scientists can develop predictive models. 
These models could predict future geochemical trends or contribute to the discovery of new resources.

**Academic research and teaching**: The API can be used in academic courses to provide students with hands-on experience 
working with real geochemical datasets.


## Accessibility and user-friendliness

A crucial aspect of the GEOROC 2.0 API is its accessibility. The Jupyter notebook provided offers an easy way to start 
using the API without the need for installations. It can be run directly in Binder, an open-source web application that 
allows Jupyter notebooks to be created, shared and reproduced in a cloud environment. This makes it easy to get started 
and promotes the broad application of the database for a variety of research and development projects.
