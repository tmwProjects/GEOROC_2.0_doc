# GEOROC 2.0 API

The GEOROC 2.0 API (Application Programming Interface) represents a significant advance in the provision of and access to comprehensive geochemical data. This API is specifically designed for scientists, researchers and data analysts in the geosciences and provides a structured and efficient way to access a wide range of geochemical data.

## Basic functionality of the GEOROC 2.0 API

1. access points (endpoints): The API defines specific endpoints that allow access to different datasets. Each endpoint is designed for a specific type of request and provides specific data, such as information on certain minerals, rock types or geographical regions. <br><br>

2. requests: Users can send requests to these endpoints to retrieve data. These requests can contain parameters that specify what data is required, such as the chemical composition of a particular mineral or data from a specific geographic location. <br><br>

3. response and data format: The API processes the requests and sends back responses. These responses contain the requested data, typically in an easily processable format such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This allows users to process the data in their own systems or applications. <br><br>

4. integration and flexibility: The GEOROC 2.0 API is designed to integrate seamlessly with various scientific software tools and analysis platforms. This allows users to process and analyse the data according to their own specific requirements and in the context of their research. <br><br>


### Advantages of using the GEOROC 2.0 API

**Efficiency**: Fast and direct access to extensive geochemical data.

**Flexibility**: Customisation of data requests to meet specific research needs.

**Compatibility**: Easy integration with existing data processing and analysis tools.

**Timeliness**: Access to the latest available data.

This API provides a valuable resource for the geoscience community by simplifying access to and use of large-scale geochemical data. Whether you are involved in basic or applied geoscience research, the GEOROC 2.0 API provides you with the tools and data you need to take your research to the next level.
